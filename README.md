# address-book

This is a small web app that allows users to see the contact details of people and organisations as well as create, edit and delete them.

### Process

This was the first time I made a web app and used a NoSQL database so I had a lot to learn in a short amount of time and really tried my best. To start with, I looked at each of the requirements and based on them decided how I would implement the features. For example, the need to have persistent data and the fact that the address book is for a single person lead to the use of IndexedDB, which is an API for client-side storage of structured data.

I believe the web app meets the requirements as it lists the contact details of people and organisations, and list items can be created, edited and deleted using the forms. Having said that, I realize there are many things I can improve on, for example making the code cleaner, making the web page more responsive, disallowing duplicate entries and grouping people who are in the same organisation together. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I was not able to implement those features.

Iâ€™d love to talk more about the web app and the development process in person.
